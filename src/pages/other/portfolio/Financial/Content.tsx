                            <p>
                            In this scenario, Elegan was employed to migrate transaction data from two different customer formats into a standardized desired output format. Our systems ability to intelligently map and transform data from multiple sources with varying formats has greatly streamlined our customers data migration process when onboarding new clients. 
                            
                            </p>
                            <p>It has eliminated the need for manual intervention and reduced the time and resources required to integrate data from different systems. This has allowed the company, and it's customers, to focus on its core business operations while ensuring data accuracy and consistency across its systems.

                            <p>
                            Elegan has intelligently parsed and mapped the fields from these two disparate formats into a unified schema in the desired combined output. We mapped TXN_ID from file 1 and REFERENCE from file 2 into a new field called EXTERNAL ID, which serves as the original identifier for each transaction. 
                            
                            </p>
                            <p>Additionally, our model has generated a new unique identifier called INTERNAL ID for each transaction in the combined format, in which a custom function was used.
Our system has also extracted the transaction dates from the DATE fields in both input files and standardized them into a consistent format in the TRANSACTION DATE field. It converted the transaction amounts into Pounds Sterling (Â£) based on the live exchange rate.
